        <h1> About Diwali...</h1>
        <div class="box">
            <p>Diwali, often called the "Festival of Lights," has rich stories and traditions associated with it. The
                most famous story in Hindu tradition is from the epic Ramayana, where Lord Rama, the prince of Ayodhya,
                returns home after a 14-year exile. During his time away, he faced many hardships, including the
                abduction of his wife, Sita, by the demon king Ravana. With the help of Hanuman and an army of devoted
                allies, Rama defeated Ravana and rescued Sita. When Rama, Sita, and his brother Lakshmana returned to
                Ayodhya, the people joyfully welcomed them by lighting rows of oil lamps (diyas), celebrating the
                victory of good over evil.

                Diwali is also deeply connected to Goddess Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth and prosperity.
                According to legend, she was born on the night of the new moon, known as Amavasya, which falls during
                Diwali. People light lamps and offer prayers to welcome her into their homes, believing she will bring
                wealth, good fortune, and happiness. The day is therefore not only about light but also about inviting
                blessings for a prosperous year ahead.

                For Sikhs, Diwali has a different significance. It commemorates the release of the sixth Sikh Guru, Guru
                Hargobind Ji, from imprisonment under the Mughal emperor Jahangir. The Guru was freed from the Gwalior
                Fort along with 52 other princes, symbolizing the Sikh values of freedom and justice. Sikhs honor this
                day as Bandi Chhor Divas, or the "Day of Liberation," and celebrate it as part of Diwali.

                In Jainism, Diwali marks a sacred event in the life of Lord Mahavira, the 24th and last Tirthankara. On
                this day in 527 BCE, Mahavira attained Nirvana, or spiritual liberation, in a profound state of
                enlightenment. For Jains, Diwali is a time to reflect on the teachings of Mahavira and the importance of
                liberation from worldly attachments.

                Some Buddhist communities, particularly in India, also associate Diwali with Emperor Ashoka's conversion
                to Buddhism. After witnessing the devastation of the Kalinga War, Ashoka embraced Buddhism and dedicated
                his life to spreading its peaceful teachings. For Buddhists, Diwali can represent a time of peace,
                non-violence, and spiritual awakening.</p>
